## Critical Vulnerability Fixed: Exposed Supabase Service Role JWT

### Overview
A critical security vulnerability was identified and remediated where Supabase Service Role JWT tokens were hardcoded in the application source code. This vulnerability was detected by GitGuardian security scanning.

### Vulnerability Details
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Type**: Hardcoded secrets in source code
- **Affected Files**: `api/lib/supabase.ts`
- **Exposed Secrets**:
  - Supabase Service Role Key (JWT)
  - Supabase Anonymous Key (JWT)

### Remediation Actions Taken

1. **Removed Hardcoded Secrets**
   - Eliminated all hardcoded JWT tokens from `api/lib/supabase.ts`
   - Implemented mandatory environment variable validation
   - Added proper error handling for missing environment variables

2. **Environment Variable Enforcement**
   - All Supabase configuration now requires environment variables
   - Application will fail to start if required secrets are missing
   - No fallback values to prevent accidental exposure

3. **Updated Configuration Files**
   - `.env.example` contains only placeholder values
   - `.gitignore` properly excludes all environment files

### Required Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be configured:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-256-bits
```

### Security Best Practices

#### 1. Secret Management
- **Never** commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Rotate secrets regularly (recommended: every 90 days)
- Use different secrets for different environments

#### 2. Supabase Key Rotation
If you suspect your Supabase keys have been compromised:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API
   - Click "Reset" next to Service Role Key
   - Update all deployment environments with new keys
   - Monitor for unauthorized access

2. **Generate New Keys**:
   - Service Role Key: Full database access (backend only)
   - Anon Key: Public access with RLS policies (frontend safe)

#### 3. Environment Setup

**Development**:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual values
```

**Production (Vercel)**:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add all required variables from `.env.example`
3. Set appropriate environment scope (Production, Preview, Development)

**Production (Other Platforms)**:
- Use platform-specific secret management
- Never use `.env` files in production
- Consider using secret management services (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)

#### 4. Code Review Guidelines
- Always review environment variable usage
- Ensure no hardcoded secrets in pull requests
- Use automated security scanning (GitGuardian, etc.)
- Validate that `.env` files are properly gitignored

### Monitoring and Detection

1. **Automated Scanning**
   - GitGuardian integration for secret detection
   - Regular dependency vulnerability scans
   - Code quality checks in CI/CD pipeline

2. **Access Monitoring**
   - Monitor Supabase dashboard for unusual activity
   - Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
   - Regular audit of user permissions and access logs

### Incident Response

If secrets are accidentally exposed:

1. **Immediate Response** (within 1 hour):
   - Rotate all potentially compromised secrets
   - Remove secrets from version control history if needed
   - Update all deployment environments

2. **Investigation** (within 24 hours):
   - Review access logs for unauthorized usage
   - Identify scope of potential compromise
   - Document incident and lessons learned

3. **Prevention**:
   - Implement additional security measures
   - Update development processes
   - Provide team security training
